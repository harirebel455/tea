    		<h2>Flat White</h2>
    		<img src="https://www.coffeemakersadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Flat-White-1.jpg">
    		<p>Unless you have visited Australia or New Zealand, you may have never heard of a flat white coffee. This drink is one of the two most famous Kiwi coffees, the other being a long black, both of which are originally from New Zealand and Australia. To make a flat white, you simply take the steamed milk from the bottom of the jug and poor it over one shot of espresso.</p>

    		<h2>Frappe</h2>
    		<img src="https://www.coffeemakersadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Frappe-1.jpg">
    		<p>When you hear “frappe” your mind may lean more towards the McDonald’s frappes, whose appearance may more closely resemble a dessert rather than a coffee. However, despite the fact that the word is of French origin, the frappe coffee beverage actually originates from Greece. The frappe, which is quite popular in cafes throughout Greece, was first created in 1957 on accident by Dimitris Vakondios</p>

    		<h2>Breve</h2>
    		<img src="https://www.coffeemakersadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Breve.jpg">
    		<p>If you are a fan of lattes or cappuccinos, you will most likely enjoy breve coffee, as well. It is counted in the weaker side of the coffee spectrum and it is one of the best choices if you are found of a cup of coffee which is rich in milk. Breve coffee is simply an espresso-based drink that is made with steamed half-and-half, rather than traditional steamed milk. This delicious espresso drink is the American version of the classic Italian latte, boasting more creamy foam than an Italian latte.</p>

    		<h2>Eiscaffee</h2>
    		<img src="https://www.coffeemakersadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Eiscaffee-1.jpg">
    		<p>Another coffee drink that resembles a dessert is eiscaffee, a type of cold coffee made in a rather peculiar way. Originally from Germany, eiscaffee is made by mixing coffee and ice cream together, creating a sweet and creamy coffee drink. This beverage is as simple as adding two or three scoops of your favorite ice cream into a glass, followed by brewed coffee. You may even top this off with whipped cream </p>

    		<h2>Black Tie</h2>
    		<img src="https://www.coffeemakersadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Tie.jpg">
    		<p>The final type of coffee that is worth experimenting with is a black tie, a specialty of Thailand. A black tie is a mix of tea, espresso, and other flavorful ingredients. This drink is ideal for those who prefer both tea and coffee, with its unique mix of the two beverages into one chilled drink that both refreshes and energizes. The key to enjoying a quality cup of black tie is to use Thai tea, which is available in most health food shops or even online</p>

    		<h2>Irish Coffee</h2>
    		<img src="https://www.coffeemakersadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Irish-Coffee-1.jpg">
    		<p>This type of coffee may also provide you with an extra boost if you choose to order it instead of a traditional cup of coffee. As its name suggests, this type of coffee originates from Ireland in 1942, specifically at the Shannon Airport, when it was used to calm passengers who were stranded. Irish coffee is made from brewed coffee mixed with whiskey, sugar, and heavy cream on top. This drink is a wonderful and creative way to enjoy the soothing taste and aroma of coffee while at the pub with friends or at a restaurant</p>
